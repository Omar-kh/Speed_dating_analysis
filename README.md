# Speed_dating_analysis
Data visualization to look for the elements influencing the success of speed dating events

# Introduction
This is the repo to share progress on the project between the two collaborators.

# Workflow
The ideal workflow at this point is probably to have each analysis (e.g. influence of attractiveness on the matching result) in a separate notebook to avoid conflicts.
Then, at each session the collaborators would present their progress to each other and decide on keeping the workflow or changing it.

At the end, the whole analysis may be merged (or not) in order to have a more consistent presentation of the project.
